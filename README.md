## Unit 6 Assignment 

* Code: 6_correlation.ipynb
* Data: iris.csv, weatherAUS.csv, wine.csv

### Task A: Iris data

Perform K-Means clustering on the dataset, iris.csv (from the UCI Machine Learning Repository). Before using the data for clustering, you might have to remove a few columns because the K-Means algorithm involves the calculation of Euclidian distance. You can choose various values of K; however, you must also choose K = 3 in this case. Upon clustering at K = 3, check how much similar your three clusters are as compared to the labels of species – setosa, versicolour, and verginica.

### Task B: Wine data

Perform K-Means clustering on the dataset, wine.csv (from the UCI Machine Learning Repository). Before using the data for clustering, you might have to remove a few columns like in the previous task. You can choose various values of K; however, you must also choose K = 3 in this case. Upon clustering at K = 3, check how much similar your three clusters are as compared to the labels of wines – 1, 2, and 3.

### Task C: WeatherAUS data

Perform K-Means clustering on the dataset, weatherAUS.csv (from the Kaggle site). Again, you will have to remove a few columns from this data and make it useful for clustering. Play with a range of values of K, from, K=2 to K=6 and try to visualise the results of clustering using two-dimensional scatter plots.
